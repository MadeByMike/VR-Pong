	<p><strong>What the heck is VR Pong?</strong></p>
	<p class="mike-left">That's an awesome question and I should know because I wrote it.
	VR Pong is a little project started by <a href="https://twitter.com/Una">Una Kravets</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeRiethmuller">Mike Riethmuller</a> to have some fun, learn about WebVR and hopefully make something cool. It's like that game you might have played as a kid where you write one
	line of a story and someone else&hellip;</p>
	<p class="una-left">&hellip;finishes it. Each week one of us adds something to a VR scene built with <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a>, writes a short blog post about it, then passes it back to the other person. Eventually we might invite other people to submit pull requests as guest VR Pong players.</p>
