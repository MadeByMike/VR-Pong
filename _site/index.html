	<p><strong>What the heck is VR Pong?</strong></p>
	<p class="mike-left">That's an awesome question and I should know because I wrote it.
	VR Pong is a little project started by <a href="https://twitter.com/Una">Una Kravets</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeRiethmuller">Mike Riethmuller</a> to have some fun, learn about WebVR and hopefully make something cool. It's like that game you might have played as a kid where you write one
	line of a story and someone else&hellip;</p>
	<p class="una-left">&hellip;finishes it. Each week one of us adds something to a VR scene built with <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a>, writes a short blog post about it, then passes it back to the other person. Eventually we might invite other people to submit pull requests as guest VR Pong players.</p>

	Week one will probably be a slightly longer blog post that will cover the setup and some of the core concepts of WebVR and A-Frame along with my initial creative thinking and explorations. Itâ€™s likely that these two voices, the technical and creative will feature heavily in this and future blog posts. On the technical side I learnt about setting up a project with A-Frame and building scenes using components, entities, primitives and assets. On the creative side I explored using limited pallets and fine tuned the animations and reflections.
